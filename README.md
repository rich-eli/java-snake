## Snake game written in Java.

A rendition of the classic arcade game "Snake". It is a single-player game where the player maneuvers the end of a growing line, often themed as a snake. The player must keep the snake from colliding with obstacles and itself, which gets harder as the snake lengthens.

In this version, possible ways of triggering a game over is when the snake collides with itself or the edges of the game boundaries.
